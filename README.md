📉 Predicting the 2008 Financial Crisis Using LSTM
A Machine Learning Approach to Economic Forecasting






📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks can be used for predicting economic downturns, specifically analyzing the 2008 Financial Crisis.

Using key economic indicators, we train an LSTM model to detect recessionary trends and explore how machine learning can improve economic forecasting.

✅ Key Features:

📊 Time-Series Analysis of economic data
🔍 LSTM Neural Network for forecasting
📉 Economic Indicators like GDP growth, unemployment, and interest rates
🛠 Data Preprocessing & Anomaly Handling
📈 Visualization of Predictions
