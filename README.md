Project Title: Predicting the 2008 Financial Crisis Using LSTM
Project Summary
This project demonstrates how Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks can be used to predict economic downturns, specifically focusing on the 2008 Financial Crisis. Using a small, educational dataset, we implement an LSTM model to analyze key economic indicators and detect recessionary trends. This project is intended for educational purposes, showcasing how machine learning can enhance economic forecasting.

Key Features
Time Series Forecasting: Uses LSTM networks to analyze economic trends.
Economic Indicators: Processes data such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and interest rates.
Deep Learning with Keras & TensorFlow: Implements an LSTM model for prediction.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and structures it for ML models.
Visualization & Insights: Plots key trends and model predictions to assess performance.
Files & Structure
